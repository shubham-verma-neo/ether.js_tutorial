### Common Terminologies

####    Provider 
            A Provider (in ether) is a class which provides an abstraction for a connection to the Ethereum
                Network. It provides read-only access to the Blockchain and its status.

####    Signer
            A Signer is a class which in some way directly or indirectly has access to a private key,
                which can sign messages and transactions to authorize the network to charge your account ether
                to perform operations.
        
####    Contract
            A Contract is an abstraction which represents a connection to specific contract on the Ethereum 
                Network, so that applications can use it like a normal JavaScript object.
